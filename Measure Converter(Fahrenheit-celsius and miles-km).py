# Task-1:
# Write a short Python program that asks the user to enter Celsius temperature (it can be a decimal number),
# converts the entered temperature into Fahrenheit degree and prints the result.
#
# Task-2:
# Write a short Python program that asks the user to enter a distance (it can be a decimal number) in kilometers,
# converts the entered distance into miles and prints the result.

# Task-1:
c = input("enter celcius temperature:")
f = 33.8
print("Fahrenheit degree :" , float(c) * f)

# Task-2:
k = input("enter kilometers:")
m = 0.621371192
print("miles :", float(k) * float(m))
